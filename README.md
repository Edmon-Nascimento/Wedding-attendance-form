# Wedding attendance form
 A simple form site that send messages to an email using EmailJS. 
 
 The project is totally based on HTML, CSS and JS to be easily hosted on github pages.

 I needed a form to do the confirmation of the guests of my wedding but thereÂ´s any free model with a nice design. So, i decided create my own website. 
 
 This project has a special meaning for me beacause it's part of a incredible moment in my life and was a great way to pratice my skills as well.
